/**
 * This class is a delegate for nested columns found frequently in the DSL, such
 * as inside the {@code createTable} change.  It can handle both normal columns,
 * as found in the {@code createTable} change, and the
 * {@code LoadDataColumnConfig} columns that can be found in the {@code loadData}
 * change.  When the {@link ChangeSetDelegate} creates a ColumnDelegate for a,
 * given change, it will need to set the correct columnConfigClass.
 * <p>
 * This class also handles the nested where clause that appears in the
 * {@code update} and {@code delete} changes.  This probably does not cohere
 * with the overall purpose of the class, but it is much better than having to
 * duplicate the column processing logic since the {@code update} change uses
 * columns and a where clause.
 * <p>
 * This delegate will expand expressions to make databaseChangeLog property
 * substitutions.  It is important that the caller does not do it again.
